               India's big-budget, hi-tech Adlabs Imagicaa opened in 2013. Modeled on Universal Studios, it has more than 30 themed rides (including the country's largest roller coaster and 4D stimulation rides) and eight themed restaurants. 
               The idea behind it is to enable escapism through fantasy and the bringing alive of stories. As part of the second and third phases of development, Aqua Magica Water Park opened in September 2014, followed by the opening of the five-star Novotel Imagica Khopoli hotel in September 2015.
               A Snow Park was launched in April 2016. This makes it a very attractive vacation option for families.

        <div class="scroll blue">
           <p class="para"> Kingdom of Dreams, opened in 2010, is a huge live entertainment and leisure destination that brings together the carnival that is India. It encompasses both Indian culture and performing arts. The highlight is Culture Gully, an elaborate arts, crafts, and culinary boulevard—complete with street performers. It's like an air-conditioned version of Dilli Haat. Other features include a state-of-the-art auditorium (Nautanki Mahal) for live productions, and a multi-faceted theater space (Showshaa). Don't miss seeing a live Bollywood musical!

    <h2>WONDERLA BANGLORE</h2>
    <div class="scroll blue">
       <p class="para">  Wonderla is a world-class amusement park chain that's expanding across India. The park in Bangalore is the best and has over 50 rides. 12 rides are water-based, 13 are especially for small children, and 10 are high-thrill. If you love getting wet, don't miss the Rain Disco—an indoor dance floor with psychedelic laser lights and a rain system that provides showers of warm water, choreographed to the music. There's also a resort on the premises, so you can stay there.
